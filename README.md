### CASA0019_Sensor-Data-Visualisation

## Purpose
LondonAQ is a multiple-value gauge which displays real-time air quality data to the public. Since there are 9,400 premature deaths per year are attributed to poor air quality in London (London Councils), there must be a way to reveal the issue and to call for action in a simple and intuitive way.

LondonAQ offers a quick way to identify a range of values by the colour coding in its dial. It visualises the concentrations of four pollutants and the air quality index on the physical gauge and its digital counterpart.

## Use
Users can see the pointers are sync in physical gauge and the virtual one, allowing users to check the readings wherever and whenever they want.

LondonAQ also provides an opportunity to display the data for various areas by choosing the location on its App, giving more user engagement and evoking people's curiosity.

## Data Source
# What is AQI?
An Air Quality Index (AQI) is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how pollute the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. Public health risks increase as the AQI rises.

# Why we choose?
- Current state with every 10 min update
- Provide all weather alerts from the entire world
- High accuracy between 90% and 100% with inaccuracy about 1%

# Open Weather Map Air Pollution API
https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution
The following elements are chosen to display as they are the AQI standard of the Open Weather Map Air Pollution API:
1. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
2. Inhalable particles (PM10)
3. Fine inhalable particles (PM2.5)
4. Ozone (O3)
5. Air Quality Index (AQI)
